    About Me

<div class = "general-div">
    <div>
        <p>
            From a young age, I've been driven by an insatiable curiosity to understand the mysteries of the universe. This passion led me to pursue a degree in physics at Loyola University Chicago, where I dreamed of one day earning a PhD and becoming a theoretical physicist.

            However, life had other plans. Despite earning scholarships and working multiple jobs to fund my education, financial constraints prevented me from immediately pursuing graduate school.
            Instead of letting this setback define me, I chose to embrace a new path â€“ one that bridges my love for physics with the practical application of programming.

            Throughout my journey, I've developed a strong work ethic and adaptability.
            From coaching hockey to maintaining parks and working in customer service, I've honed my ability to connect with people from all walks of life.
            These experiences have taught me the value of teamwork, attention to detail, and the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity.

            Now, as I embark on a career in professional programming, I bring with me a unique perspective shaped by my background in physics.
            I am excited to apply my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities to uncover insights hidden within complex datasets.
            Just as physicists seek to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, I am driven to explore the vast potential of data to drive innovation and solve real-world challenges.
